# single attempt: a provable control-plane rejection lands in
# enqueue_async_processing's quiet synchronous fallback; anything else

# already be queued — and 500s so ClickUp redelivers instead of the inline
# path double-running the work (see enqueue_async_processing).

# total_max_attempts, NOT max_attempts — a botocore trap: in legacy retry
# mode (the default) "max_attempts" counts RETRIES AFTER the initial call,
# so {"max_attempts": 1} normalizes to total_max_attempts=2 — one silent
# full retry on this budget-critical path. "total_max_attempts" counts the

# too. Tight timeouts, single attempt (total_max_attempts — see the
# max_attempts trap on LAMBDA_CLIENT_CONFIG): a timeout surfaces as an

**Approach this ticket with healthy skepticism.** It may be out of date - the issue
could have been fixed, the data may have changed, the description may be incomplete,

**BEFORE writing any code**, you MUST:
1. Find all files that use/import the function or component you plan to modify
2. Read each of those files to understand how they depend on it
3. Consider if your change will break any of those usages

## RED/GREEN TDD (required)

Write a **failing test** that reproduces the bug or defines the feature contract
FIRST, confirm it fails, then implement the minimum to make it pass. No production
code without a driving test. Run the affected package's test suite and lint before
opening the PR.

## SELF-REVIEW (required, after the diff is green)

Perform two self-review passes over the full diff using the rule files in the
repo's `ai-rules/` directory (bugs, breaking-changes, security, test quality),
fixing what they surface. The PR description MUST include the failing (red) test
output and the passing (green) run.
