"""L2-to-BallotReady district matcher.

Named after the warehouse objects it reads and writes
(int__l2_br_match_pending_offices, llm_l2_br_match_results) so the dbt side
and the omni side share one vocabulary.

The matcher core -- the district and query embedding text, the menu
construction, the LLM prompt, response schema and Braintrust identifiers --
is an owner-decided constraint, not reviewable, and is reproduced here, not
redesigned. What changed: inputs come from Databricks instead of laptop
pickles, embeddings live in memory for the run and are discarded, and a run
persists only matches and abstentions -- a technical error fails the run
instead of being recorded as a match.

This module writes nothing. `run()` returns terminal results for the caller
to print or inspect; the Databricks write path lives beside it in
l2_br_match_writer.py.

- if the office is greater than the state level, match to the state level

Return JSON with:
• selected_candidate_number: Number (1-{num_districts}) of your choice, or 0 if no good match
• selection_confidence: Confidence level (0-100)
• reasoning: Detailed explanation of your selection or rejection
• close_alternatives: Array of candidate numbers that were very close (only if multiple options were neck-and-neck)
• is_exact_district_match: Boolean indicating whether the selected candidate matches the BR position at the same specificity level. Set true if the selected L2 candidate is at the same district specificity as the BR position (e.g., "City Council District 3" matched to a district-level L2 entry). Set false if the BR position specifies a sub-district (Ward, District, Place + number) but the selected L2 candidate is a parent-level type (City, County, Township, Borough, Village, Town_District). Set false if selected_candidate_number is 0.

IMPORTANT: Return 0 if no candidate represents a reasonable match.
There is a real probability that the match does not exist so return 0 if there is no clear match.

Base decisions on semantic meaning, geography, and functional appropriateness.
