"""Databricks write path for the L2-to-BallotReady match results.

Two operations over the one table the matcher owns -- append a batch of
results under a run key, and delete a run -- plus the validation they share.
The schema of record is `l2_br_match_schema.py` beside this module, whose
`ensure_results_table()` provisions the table by hand; dbt reads it as a
source and never creates it, which is already the convention here.

Lives beside the matcher rather than in shared/: shared/ is imported by every
other service in this package and held to mypy's strict disallow_untyped_defs,
so giving it its first write capability for one caller is a blast radius this
module avoids by depending on shared.databricks_client.DatabricksClient
instead of becoming part of it. shared/ is not modified.

The write does not have to be atomic, and this module deliberately does not
try to make it so. A half-written run is incomplete, not corrupt: there is no
status column and no cross-row invariant left for a row to violate, every row
stands on its own, and an office whose row never arrived is still on the
pending list, which is where it started. So what the writer owes instead of a
transaction is detection -- `append_results` counts what landed against what
it was asked to write -- and a documented recovery, which is `delete_run`.
That is why there is no staging table, no CREATE on one, and no truncate step.

`attempted_at` is the run key. One run stamps one value across every row it
writes, and the CALLER passes it in rather than each writer minting its own,
so a run that is sharded or resumed keeps a single key. A resumed run
anti-joins what it already wrote under that key: the matcher is not
deterministic, so two rows for one office at one timestamp are two different
answers with no rule for choosing between them.

`attempted_at` must be **timezone-aware**. It is the sole key for the
anti-join, the count and `delete_run`, and a naive value resolved under a
different session timezone on a later resume silently splits one run into
two keys, with the count check passing on both. Hand-built timestamps are
the ones that come out naive, and the baseline run stamps a hand-chosen
historical date.

    Raises ValueError naming every failing row and why, without writing
    anything.

    Two rules, and only two, because only two are both unenforced elsewhere
    and reachable from a batch this module can be handed:

    - **The district key is all set or all null.** A partial key is a writer
      bug. It is deliberately not a dbt test or a Delta CHECK (that decision
      is in the epic's ledger: per-row validation belongs in the container),
      so this is its only enforcement. The damage is quiet rather than loud:
      a partial key misses the universe join, so the office reopens on every
      pending-list build and re-pays the LLM cost forever.
    - **No duplicate br_database_id inside one batch.** The anti-join in
      `append_results` covers rows already durable under this run key; it
      cannot see two rows for one office inside the in-memory batch it is
      handed, which a sharded or concatenated run can produce. "Latest
      attempt wins" has no answer for two rows at one timestamp.

    Not checked here, deliberately, with the reason each:
    `attempted_at` and `br_database_id` nullity are `not null` in the DDL and
    Delta enforces that on write. `confidence` range is validated
    unconditionally upstream in `_selection_from_response` (integrality and
    0-100), which is the only producer of the value and the only place with a
    real failure story for it -- a model returning 3.9 and truncating to 3.
    `br_database_id` type is not checked either: `append_results` puts the id
    through a set membership test before this runs, so an unhashable one
    raises there first, and a hashable non-int can only come from a
    hand-built MatchResult. All three would guard a path that does not run.
