/**
 * In-memory per-IP token bucket for the public `/v1/briefings/:uuid` endpoint.
 *
 * The endpoint is unauthenticated and the UUID acts as a bearer token, so
 * the obvious attack is to scrape valid IDs by spraying guesses. This guard
 * keeps a tiny token-bucket per remote IP, refusing requests beyond the
 * burst + refill window.
 *
 * This is a *stopgap*: the in-memory map doesn't share across gp-api
 * instances and `request.ip` is only meaningful when fastify is configured
 * with `trustProxy` so the upstream load balancer's `X-Forwarded-For` is
 * respected. The right long-term answer is (a) Vercel/Cloudflare WAF rules
 * on `goodparty.org/api/v1/briefings/*`, and/or (b) replacing the UUID with
 * a signed/expiring share token stored in `share_tokens`. Track that in
 * follow-up before scaling shares to large volumes.
 *
 * Memory bound: an IP-rotating attacker would otherwise grow `buckets`
 * indefinitely. We mitigate via two complementary mechanisms:
 *   1. Opportunistic sweep — every `SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS` we drop any bucket
 *      that has refilled to full *and* hasn't been touched in `IDLE_TTL_MS`.
 *      Active clients keep their bucket; idle clients eventually GC.
 *   2. Hard ceiling — if the map ever exceeds `MAX_BUCKETS`, we forcibly
 *      evict the 10% oldest by `lastRefillMs`. This bounds worst-case
 *      memory regardless of how aggressively IPs are rotated.
